# Forest-Cover-Type-Predictions
Project to predict forest cover types using machine learning models (Multiclass Logistic Regression, KNN, Neural Networks, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost) 

I completed this project with a team as a part of an Applied Machine Learning course (W207) in UC Berkeley's Master of Information and Data Science Program.
